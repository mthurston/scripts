# Scripts Collection
As a hoarder of things that have code-smell I've decided to use this repo as a trove for my precious scripts. 

## Powershell
* **[Beep](./powershell/beep.ps1)** - A simple script that beeps every 30 seconds to help get my attention after a batch task has completed.

### Azure DevOps
* **[Run Pipelines](./powershell/azure-dev-ops/run-pipelines.ps1)** - Allows a windows user to kick off multiple Azure DevOps pipelines synchronously.
